# Tweets cards

The app is a straightforward tool that permits users to track and cease tracking Twitter accounts. By selecting "Follow," the button color switches to green, and the number of followers increases by one. By clicking the button again, the color returns to its original state, and the number of followers decreases by one. Each button operates autonomously of the others, and any changes made persist even after the page is reloaded. The app was created using a technology stack that includes React, Redux, Redux Toolkit and RTK Query. Task completed in full.
